Python Internship

🚀 Excited to share a project I've been working  Oasis Infobyte intern....my very own Python Voice Assistant! 🎙️💻

In this project, I've built a personalized voice assistant using Python, integrating various functionalities such as:

🔹 Voice-controlled Wikipedia search
🔹 Web search functionality
🔹 Real-time clock and date display
🔹 Email sending capability
🔹 Reminder setting feature

I've also added the ability to customize the assistant with additional commands, making it adaptable to individual preferences.

Check out the video to see the assistant in action! 👀 Let me know what you think in the comments below. I'm always open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.
